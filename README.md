# Scrive elm challenge

Hello! Welcome to the Scrive Elm Challenge.

This repository contains requirements definition of a project used for job applications
on a **position of an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) developer in Scrive**.
The whole assignment is based on a real part of our production app and real needs we had addressed.

It also contains the skeleton of an Elm app with technologies we are currently 
using - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Task parts

You have to deliver at least one part of your choice. (You can do more parts of course).

You can pick one of following parts:

- [Settings](task-settings.md)
- [Contact details](task-contact-details.md)
- [Tags](task-tags.md)


## Goal

The goal is to test your ability to come up with a solution for a real world problem which will be part of your day to day responsibility.
Obviously the first thing what we will look at is a degree to what your implementation satisfies original requirements.
Also we want to see your ability to come up with a robust solution and will look at the overall code quality.

## Where to Start

If you are interested in applying for Elm developer position or just want to challenge yourself (which is also 100% OK with us),
please continue following the steps:

- Pick at least one [task](#task-parts) and read through requirements.
- Fork this repository under your GitHub account.
- Complete an implementation inside your fork.
- Open pull request to [original](https://github.com/scrive/elm-challenge/) repository with your own implementation.
- Make your pull request ready for review to let us know that we can review your code.
- Comment your PR with any question in case you need any help (or send us email - see below).

**You can also open a draft pull request before you finish the implementation in case you want to discuss anything with us!**

Good luck and enjoy the challenge.
